          <h3>Skateboarding</h3>
          <p>
            Skateboarding is an action sport that involves riding and performing
            tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an
            art form, an entertainment industry job, and a method of
            transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many
            skateboarders throughout the years.Skateboarding started in
            California in the 1950s.[2] The first skateboards were made from
            roller skates (attached to a board).[3] Skateboarding gained in
            popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially
            referred to as "sidewalk surfing". Initially, skateboards were
            handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies
            started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more
            popular.[4] In postwar America, society was carefree with children
            commonly playing in the streets.[5] Boards were also continuing to
            evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve
            their performance. Skateboarding is a very individual activity.

          <h3>Boards</h3>
          <p>
            Skateboard is a type of sports equipment used for skateboarding.
            They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply maple plywood
            deck with a polyurethane coating for smoothness and durability and
            wheels attached to the underside by a pair of skateboarding
            trucks.The two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the
            shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard
            must be concaved to perform tricks. Longboards are usually faster
            and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are
            mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.

          <h3>Street Skateboarding</h3>
          <p>
            Street skateboarding is a skateboarding discipline which focuses on
            flatground tricks, grinds, slides and aerials within urban
            environments and public spaces. Street skateboarders meet, skate and
            hang out, in and around urban areas referred to as "spots", which
            are commonly streets, plazas or industrial areas
